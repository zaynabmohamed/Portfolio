# TODO: Fix Skills Component Animation Overlap

- [x] Rename the second array from 'tool' to 'advancedTools' for consistency
- [x] Define new animation arrays (xAxis2, yAxis2, rotateDegree2, initialRotation2, zIndex2) for the second set of cards to prevent overlap
- [x] Update the second motion.div section to use the new animation arrays and 'advancedTools'
- [x] Adjust positioning CSS classes if needed for better layout
